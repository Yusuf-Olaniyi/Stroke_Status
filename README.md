## Summary of Project

> I used Python Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib and Seaborn for the data assessment and cleaning.
> During the assessment, there is an imbalance in the target variable i.e stroke status so I used imblearn for over sampling.
> After solving the imbalance, I trained the model on various classification algorithm including Decision tree classifier and XGBoost.
> To achieve optimal result, I used GridSearchCV for tuning the hyperparameters for each of the models.
> I selected the best model based on the Precision and Accuracy from the confusion matrix plot.
> I saved the best model using pickle and deployed on my local gadget using streamlit.

## Projections for the Project
> I am looking for a medical expert that can provide more information that could be used to provide more features which can improve the performance of the algorithm.
> I am willing to collaborate with any organisation that can provide a large dataset that can be used to train a neural network to attain optimal result.
> I would be collaborate with mobile applications developer to deploy the model in an application that can be used across the globe.
